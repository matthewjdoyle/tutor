  },
  {
    question: "How are the online sessions conducted?",
    answer: "All sessions are conducted one-on-one via video call using platforms like Zoom or Google Meet. We'll use a collaborative online whiteboard, which allows us to work through problems together just like we would in person.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide learning materials?",
    answer: "Yes, I provide a range of materials including summary notes, practice worksheets, and past paper questions. After each session, you will receive a digital copy of the notes and problems we covered.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long are the sessions and how do I book?",
    answer: "Standard sessions are 60 minutes long, but this can be adjusted based on student needs. You can book a session by using the contact form on the website to arrange a free initial consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you track a student's progress?",
    answer: "Progress is tracked through regular topic-based assessments, feedback on homework, and performance in mock examinations. I provide regular feedback to both students and parents to highlight areas of improvement and celebrate successes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "If you cancel more than 24 hours before a scheduled lesson there is no charge and we can simply reschedule. Cancellations made within 24 hours are charged at 75 % of the usual lesson fee. If this happens more than twice in a calendar month, any further late cancellations that month are charged at the full lesson price.",
  },
  {
    question: "How and when do I pay for lessons?",
    answer: "Invoices are issued at the end of each week and are payable within 7 days by bank transfer or debit / credit card. Multi-hour packages (e.g. 12-hour bundles) are invoiced in advance to secure the discount. Lessons are only confirmed once payment has been received.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you record lessons and how is my data kept secure?",
    answer: "Lessons are not routinely recorded. Any files we share – notes, worksheets, Excalidraw boards or OneNote pages – are stored in a private Google Drive folder that only you and I can access. Your personal information is never shared with third parties.",
